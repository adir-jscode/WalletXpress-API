# WalletXpress-API

A secure, modular, and role-based backend API for a digital wallet system (similar to Bkash or Nagad) built with Express.js and Mongoose.

## üéØ Project Overview

DigitalXpress enables users to register, manage wallets, and perform core financial operations such as add money, withdraw, and send money. The system supports three roles: **admin**, **user**, and **agent**, each with specific permissions and capabilities.

## üì¶ Key Features

### üîê Security & Authentication

- **JWT-based authentication** for all roles
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt
- **Role-based authorization** middleware to protect sensitive routes
- **OTP-based email verification** via Nodemailer
- _Note: Sometimes emails may be delivered to the spam folder. Please check your spam/junk folder if you do not see the OTP or reset link in your inbox._

### üíº Wallet Management

- Automatic wallet creation for **users** and **agents** at registration
- Initial balance of **‡ß≥50**
- Admins can **block/unblock wallets** instantly

### üîÅ Transaction Management

- Transactions are **atomic** ‚Äî balance changes and logs update together
- Types: `add`, `withdraw`, `send`, `cash-in`, `cash-out`
- Track **amount, type, fee, commission, initiator, status**
- Status workflow: `pending ‚Üí completed ‚Üí reversed`

### üë• Role-Specific Capabilities

- **Users:** Deposit, withdraw, send money, view personal transaction history
- **Agents:** Perform cash-in/cash-out for users, view commission history
- **Admins:** View all wallets/users/transactions, approve/suspend agents, set system parameters

### ‚úÖ Core Validations

- Prevent transactions on **blocked wallets**
- Check **sufficient balance** before withdrawal or transfer
- Enforce valid receiver existence
- Disallow negative amounts

### üß± Modular Architecture

- Organized into feature modules: `auth/`, `user/`, `wallet/`, `transaction/`, `admin/`
- Clean separation of models, services, controllers, and routes

---

## üè¶ Wallet Management

- Wallets are automatically created for users and agents during registration ([`UserServices.createUser`](src/app/modules/user/user.service.ts)).
- Initial balance: ‡ß≥50.
- Only admins can block/unblock wallets ([`AdminServices.blockUnlockUserWallets`](src/app/modules/admin/admin.service.ts)).
- Blocked wallets cannot perform operations.

---

## üîÅ Transaction Management

- Transactions include: type, amount, fee, commission, initiator, status.
- Statuses: pending, completed, reversed.
- All balance updates and transaction records are atomic ([`WalletServices`](src/app/modules/wallet/wallet.service.ts)).
- Transaction history is available for users and agents.

---

## üë• Roles

- **User**: Can add, withdraw, send money, and view transaction history.
- **Agent**: Can cash-in/cash-out for users, view commission history.
- **Admin**: Can view all data, block/unblock wallets, approve/suspend agents.

Roles are managed via a single User model with a `role` field ([`Role`](src/app/modules/user/user.interface.ts)).

---

## üß† Validations & Business Rules

- Insufficient balance, non-existent receiver, negative amounts are validated.
- Blocked wallets cannot perform transactions.
- Agents cannot cash-in/out for blocked wallets.
- All business rules enforced via service and middleware layers.

---

## üìú Access & Visibility

- Users/agents can view their own wallet and transaction history.
- Admins can view all users, agents, wallets, and transactions.
- Data access is protected by role-based middleware ([`checkAuth`](src/app/middlewares/checkAuth.ts)).

---

## üîê Role-Based Control

- **Admin-only endpoints**: View all users/agents/wallets/transactions, block/unblock wallets, approve/suspend agents.
- **User-only endpoints**: Withdraw, send money, view own transactions.
- **Agent-only endpoints**: Cash-in/cash-out, view commission history.
- Authorization enforced via middleware.
