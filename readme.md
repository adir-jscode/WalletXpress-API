# DigitalXpress - Digital Wallet API

A secure, modular, and role-based backend API for a digital wallet system (similar to Bkash or Nagad) built with Express.js and Mongoose.

## üéØ Project Overview

DigitalXpress enables users to register, manage wallets, and perform core financial operations such as add money, withdraw, and send money. The system supports three roles: **admin**, **user**, and **agent**, each with specific permissions and capabilities.

---

## üì¶ Features

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure login for all roles.
- **Role-based Authorization**: Protects routes and operations based on user role.
- **Automatic Wallet Creation**: Wallets are created for users and agents during registration with an initial balance of ‡ß≥50.
- **Wallet Operations**:
  - Add money (top-up)
  - Withdraw money
  - Send money to other users
  - Cash-in/cash-out by agents
- **Transaction Management**: All transactions are stored and trackable.
- **Admin Controls**:
  - View all users, agents, wallets, and transactions
  - Block/unblock user wallets
  - Approve/suspend agents
- **Modular Code Architecture**: Organized by modules for scalability and maintainability.

---

## üè¶ Wallet Management

- Wallets are automatically created for users and agents during registration ([`UserServices.createUser`](src/app/modules/user/user.service.ts)).
- Initial balance: ‡ß≥50.
- Only admins can block/unblock wallets ([`AdminServices.blockUnlockUserWallets`](src/app/modules/admin/admin.service.ts)).
- Blocked wallets cannot perform operations.

---

## üîÅ Transaction Management

- Transactions include: type, amount, fee, commission, initiator, status.
- Statuses: pending, completed, reversed.
- All balance updates and transaction records are atomic ([`WalletServices`](src/app/modules/wallet/wallet.service.ts)).
- Transaction history is available for users and agents.

---

## üë• Roles

- **User**: Can add, withdraw, send money, and view transaction history.
- **Agent**: Can cash-in/cash-out for users, view commission history.
- **Admin**: Can view all data, block/unblock wallets, approve/suspend agents.

Roles are managed via a single User model with a `role` field ([`Role`](src/app/modules/user/user.interface.ts)).

---

## üß† Validations & Business Rules

- Insufficient balance, non-existent receiver, negative amounts are validated.
- Blocked wallets cannot perform transactions.
- Agents cannot cash-in/out for blocked wallets.
- All business rules enforced via service and middleware layers.

---

## üìú Access & Visibility

- Users/agents can view their own wallet and transaction history.
- Admins can view all users, agents, wallets, and transactions.
- Data access is protected by role-based middleware ([`checkAuth`](src/app/middlewares/checkAuth.ts)).

---

## üîê Role-Based Control

- **Admin-only endpoints**: View all users/agents/wallets/transactions, block/unblock wallets, approve/suspend agents.
- **User-only endpoints**: Withdraw, send money, view own transactions.
- **Agent-only endpoints**: Cash-in/cash-out, view commission history.
- Authorization enforced via middleware.
